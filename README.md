# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## The Task
The main purpose of this task was to improve the accesibility of both the source code and the webpage itself. This involved adding alt tags to images on the webpage, changing element tag names to something more descriptive, fixing the hyperlinks on page to jump to the relevant section and consolidating the differently named CSS classes into fewer classes that could be applied to multiple elements.
